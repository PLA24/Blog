### Monday
Today was the Sprint peer review of sprint 2. Sprint 2 had the same deliverables as sprint 1, but in this sprint you should have processed all the previous feedback and some things of your product should be working. Today we presented our documentation, the website which had all the pages by now, the map and a small demenstration of the car counting sensor, but the sensor wasn't linked to the map or the website. In the end they expected more of us and that is why we got a NO-GO this time.

### Wednesday
Today we didn't do much because we had a break coming up. But we did divide all the work that had to be done because of the NO-GO that we got. We left for home early today.
