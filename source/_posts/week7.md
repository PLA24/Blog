## this week (7)

### Monday 
Today was the end of sprint 1 and also the sprint peer review. We had to present our shippable product to the product owner Arthur. We also had to show a short video that would describe our product. We made a small animation which the assessors liked a lot. They said that our idea was good but not refined enough yet, So we got a GO-MITS. When the peer review was done, we went back to our usual classroom and we wrote the retrospective for this sprint.

### Wednesday
This day was the start of sprint 2. Today we were working on the feedback that we got on the peer review. We also had to think about how we would refine our idea. First we changed our target audience to just one instead of three and next we added a climate part to our idea.
