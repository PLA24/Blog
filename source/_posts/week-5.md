## this week (5)

### Monday 
Today we picked of from where we left of last time (before the holiday). We all went on to do various tasks pinned on the Trello backlog, except for Souhail, he called in sick today. Cornell on the other hand made a new card special for him, this because he was in a lot of stress about his late project(he had to resit this specific project). We made a team decision to grant him some time to overcome his stressful situation. This so that when he finishes his task, his focus will be on our current project and we can work most efficient again. 

### Wednesday
Today we went on with various tasks on the Trello board. Ziggy called in sick today, and Souhail still had not recovered from his earlier sickness. Although they were sick, they starded working from home. Furthermore we had a feedback session with Arthur, he gave some feedback concerning our audience analysis. After this feedback we put the audience analysis back on the Trello board, and we fixed it right away. Another thing we came across during the feedback session, is the lack of contact with our audience. We intend on making contact with our audience as soon as possible, we will do this through the use of e-mail and phone traffic.
