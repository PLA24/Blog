Welcome to the first post on this blog! This format is our weekly summary, we will post weekly updates here on what is going on in the project. We will also post regular updates with every couple git commits.

## This week

### Monday

On monday we had our first project presentation. Our professors explained what we will be doing the next couple of weeks, and gave a little insight on what we are supposed to do.

After that we met each other for the first time, with a 'game' to get to know each other.

### Wednesday

On wednesday, we had a presentation from a [PlanetÂ®](https://www.planet.com/) employee, explaining the company's history and their plans for satellite imagery.
After the presentation, we participated in a workshop on creative brainstorming & target audience analysis. While brainstorming, we came up with a couple idea's for the project, but we didn't come up with something definitive.
We also setup [Trello](https://trello.com) with multiple boards for our regular R&D and our idea lists & such.
