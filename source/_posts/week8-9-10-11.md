### Monday (week 8)
Previous week we got feedback from Arthur and Daniel. We had to define our idea more and we did. Now it was time to continue our work. Today we were setting everything up for this sprint, sprint 2. We changed our product backlog on Trello. And we all started taking seperate jobs again.

### The next three weeks
The next couple of weeks we were just working on our product for real, so the technical stuff.

Week 10 was an exam week, so we did not work on PAD that week.

In these three weeks we got more pages on our site. We got a register and login-function working and we also got a small part of the car counting sensor working.
