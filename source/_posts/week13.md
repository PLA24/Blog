### Monday
Today was the first day of school after the 1 week break that we got. We got the work done that we said we would do in the break. We got the database working with the website showing testdata. We also changed the empty dashboard page into a statistics page with all kinds of graphs. The settings page got filled and Rabaelo was a step further with the sensor part.

### Wednesday
Today we gave ourself a free day as we had some free school days coming up and we already had done a lot before in the break.
