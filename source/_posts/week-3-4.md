## this week (3)

### Monday 
Today we had a product demonstration in the sense of how we foresaw the application was supposed to look like. After the demonstration we had some feedback. 
With the feedback in hand we went back to the drawing board and made a few adjustments. After this Arthur came by and he oversaw all of our work.
After this Arthur gave more feedback. So we planned to make adjustments to his feedback more on this on Wednesday's post.

### Wednesday
Today we started of with making adjustments to the Trello backlog. This because we received feedback concerning our content.
Furthermore we made a retrospective containing our pros and cons concerning our work flow as well as future changes to our work flow.
